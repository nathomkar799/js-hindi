Javascript
    => Synchronous
        =>Ek code execute hoga fir ek code execute hoga fir agla code fir agla.
    => Single Threaded Language
        JavaScript is a single-threaded interpreted language. Every browser has its own JavaScript engine. Google Chrome has the V8 engine, Mozilla Firefox has SpiderMonkey, and so on.They all are used for the same goal, because the browsers cannot directly understand JavaScript code.

These things are default beahaviour of Javascript.
